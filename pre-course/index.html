<p><strong>Joining Makers Academy</strong></p>

<p>I have had six months since being accepted to Makers to prepare mentally, physically, emotionally (pretty much every way there is!) for potentially the most challenging 12 weeks I'll ever face. Its going to be hard, every blog I have read won’t let me forget it.. but I am so excited. I am currently in the midst of the final week of the pre course (four weeks of compulsory remote studing) and it has flown by! Before I applied to Makers, reading Makers alumni’s blogs really were the game changer for me, they were so honest, passionate and enthusiastic about their time at Makers Academy. So here’s hoping - I’ll try to do the same!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Summary of Precourse week 1:</strong></p>

<p>Four hours later, and a very large glass of Rose I completed the first weeks challenge. My list of ‘history’ from the command line couldn't have been any messier!</p>

<p>Lucy, a fellow Septemberite, kept my sane when for the life of me, I couldn't figure out why my Unixoid-challenge wouldn't submit - I was in the wrong directory. Well.. lets just say I won’t be making that mistake again! </p>

<p>Unfortunately I missed the Precourse launch evening. They looked like they were having a ball as they listened to Nikesh talk though different aspects of the Makers journey, shortly followed by a trip to the local about 10m down the road. </p>

<p>It has been strongly suggested that we blog throughout the next 12 weeks as much as possible. To maximise our own learning potential if nothing else. I have never blogged before, and I am really pretty crap in the spelling and grammar department, so I am sorry in advance! </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Precourse Week 2:</strong></p>

<p>Version control and GitHub. I didn’t realise how important GitHub was until this week! I had never heard of it before, but ultimately, it is the place where potential employers will go to review our code. Github has many awesome features, including the abilities for a team push and pull each others code, allowing them to work simultaneously on the same project. Trust me, its great. </p>

<p>Week two again could not have gone any faster. I feel like I am much more confident with forking, cloning, and it really makes me appreciate how important the precourse is. It continues to prepare us in small steps for the real 12 weeks, which lie in the not so far distance now. But I am sure, not matter how much we try now, it will still hit us like a tonne of bricks. </p>

<p>I also finally got my Ghost blog up and running this week- thanks to Usmans blog! His step by step guide was welcomed with open arms to a few of us on the cohort who were really struggling. Big shout out to Usman - check out the famous blog.. <a href="http://usmanj.github.io/setting-up-a-ghost-blog-on-github/">Setting up a Ghost blog on GitHub</a></p>

<p><strong>Precourse Week 3:</strong></p>

<p>Where to start!! <br>
I’m struggling to put into words my ups and downs this week. Quickly getting out the way the fact my laptop crashed and I lost everything on it. 20 hours in Apple (Leeds, Trafford Centre and Covent Garden), two ruby days behind and a new laptop with a full night of reinstalling later… we are good to go - take two! </p>

<p>The week quickly got a lot better on the Friday when I went into Makers for the first time since my interview. I pair programmed with Joe, and it was great. I learnt so much from him, he was so patient, and I think we both came away from our first pair programming experience really chuffed with ourselves. After a brief discussion, we wanted to do something useful and wrote a script to produce random pairs, on the basis that a person does not get paired with someone they have already paired with previously. We tested the ping pong technique, where you swap the driver, navigator rolls every 15 minutes or so, and in my ignorance, 15 minutes in, I stood up ready to physically swap seats with Joe..you're probably shaking your head at me right now! Anyway, Joe contained his laughter very kindly and explained how using our new found GitHub skills, we simply make a new repo and push and pull each others code, both working on the most recent version.. using our own computers, own seat! The following link is Joe's post about what we got up to in more detail..  <a href="http://chn-challenger.github.io/pair-programming-and-more-codewars/">Pair Programming: Harriet and Joe</a> Thank you Joe.</p>

<p>After completing version 1, and a great but slightly rushed attempt of a more efficient version 2, it was time for the seniors graduation. The beers were out and the final projects where so impressive in quality and individuality. The fact that will be us in 12 weeks is completely terrifying! In the mean time, to the pub.</p>
