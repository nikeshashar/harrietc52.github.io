<p><strong>Joining Makers Academy</strong></p>

<p>I have had six months since being accepted to Makers to prepare mentally, physically, emotionally (pretty much every way there is!) for potentially the most challenging 12 weeks I'll ever face. Its going to be hard, every blog I have read won’t let me forget it… but I am so excited. I am currently in the midst of the final week of the Pre-course (four weeks of compulsory remote studying) and it has flown by! Before I applied to Makers, reading Makers alumni’s blogs really were the game changer for me - they were so honest, passionate and enthusiastic about their time at Makers Academy. So here’s hoping - I’ll try to do the same!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Summary of Precourse week 1:</strong></p>

<p>Four hours later, and a very large glass of Rosé, I completed week 1’s challenge. My list of ‘history’ from the command line couldn't have been any messier!</p>

<p>Lucy, a fellow Septemberite, kept my sane when for the life of me, I couldn't figure out why my Unixoid-challenge wouldn't submit - I was in the wrong directory. Lets just say I won’t be making that hour long mistake again! </p>

<p>Unfortunately I missed the Pre-course launch evening. Everybody looked like they were having a ball as they listened to Nikesh talk though different aspects of the Makers journey, shortly followed by a trip to the local about 10 metres down the road. </p>

<p>It has been strongly suggested that we blog throughout the next 12 weeks as much as possible. To help us keep a clear record of everything we are learning if nothing else. I have never blogged before, and I am really pretty bad in the spelling and grammar department, so I am sorry for any typos in advance! </p>

<p><strong>Precourse Week 2:</strong></p>

<p>Version control and GitHub. I didn’t realise how important GitHub was until this week. I had never heard of it before, but ultimately, it is the place where future employers will go to review our code. Github has many awesome features, including the abilities for a team push and pull each others code, allowing them to work simultaneously on the same project. Trust me, its great!</p>

<p>Week two again could not have gone any faster. I feel like I am much more confident with forking, cloning, and it really makes me appreciate how important the Pre-course is. It continues to prepare us in small steps for the real 12 weeks, which lie in the not so far distance now. But I am sure, not matter how much we try now, it will still hit us like a tonne of bricks. </p>

<p>I also finally got my Ghost blog up and running this week- thanks to Usmans blog! His step by step guide was welcomed with open arms to a few of us on the cohort who were really struggling. Big shout out to Usman - check out the famous blog.. <a href="http://usmanj.github.io/setting-up-a-ghost-blog-on-github/">Setting up a Ghost blog on GitHub</a></p>

<p><strong>Precourse Week 3:</strong></p>

<p>Where to start!! <br>
I’m struggling to put into words my ups and downs this week. Quickly getting out the way the fact my laptop crashed and I lost everything on it. 20 hours in Apple, two ruby days behind and a new laptop with a full night of reinstalling later… we are good to go - take two! </p>

<p>The week quickly got a lot better on the Friday when I went into Makers for the first time since my interview. I pair programmed with Joe, and it was great. I learnt so much from him, he was so patient, and I think we both came away from our first pair programming experience really chuffed with ourselves. After a brief discussion, we wanted to do something useful and wrote a script to produce random pairs, making sure that a person doesn’t pair with someone they had previously paired with. We tested the ping pong technique, where you swap the driver, navigator rolls every 15 minutes or so. In my ignorance exited for the first rotation, I stood up ready to physically swap seats with Joe..you're probably shaking your head at me right now! Anyway, Joe contained his laughter very kindly and explained how using our new found GitHub skills, we simply make a new repo and push and pull each others code, both working on the most recent version, own computers, own swively blue chair! The following link is Joe's post about what we got up to in more detail..  <a href="http://chn-challenger.github.io/pair-programming-and-more-codewars/">Pair Programming: Harriet and Joe</a> Thank you Joe.</p>

<p>After completing version 1, and a great but slightly rushed attempt of a more efficient version 2, it was time for the seniors graduation. The beers were out and the final projects where so impressive in quality and individuality. The fact that will be us in 12 weeks is completely terrifying! In the mean time, all Makers, past, present and future overflowed the pub.</p>

<p><strong>Precourse Week 4:</strong></p>

<p>Final week of pre-course, where has the time gone! The more I’m learning the more I realise there is to learn, and all I want right now is more time. But I am currently sat on the train down to London, having waved bye to my parents on the platform, and now I’m having a little panic that I haven’t done enough work! Slack (the messaging app we use) felt pretty quiet this weekend, so maybe I wasn’t the only one making the most of our last few days of a social life. If any family/ friends are reading this, I am so sorry I am about to go off the radar for 3 months. I’ll see you all at Christmas!</p>

<p>For the the rest of my final day of Pre-course I think I will try and avoid codewars, simply because it is just so addictive, and instead read up on some TDD and Rspec. I really can’t believe it’s September 1st tomorrow, I have been looking at the “Maker’s 12 weeks begin!” event in my calendar for so long, and its here… wish me luck, I really am going to need it! Quick trip to m&amp;s to get the first of many packed lunches, early night and let the 12 weeks begin :D </p>
