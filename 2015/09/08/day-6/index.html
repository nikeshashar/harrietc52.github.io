            <p>Today has been a hard but really encouraging day!</p>

<hr>

<p>I understood all the code I wrote with Sarah (always a good start) we progressed and the tests eventually came back green. I just feel for the first time things started to click, so that was a great feeling. Most likely gone by tomorrow, but its okay.</p>

<p>Our collaborative approach for day two of Battleships was to start with basics, the ship class, moving on to player and maybe eventually board - however we didn't actually make it past the Ship class. Our ships know if they are hit, how many times, and if they are floating or sunk. I also added tonight the different size ships, testing them individually. And then the doubles! But the ship class now is pretty big so I think thats definitely a question to ask tomorrow, which classes actually NEED what methods, but also if I am getting a bit carried away with encapsulation, water class, hit class etc!</p>

<hr>

<p>Our research project today was on the SOLID principle: Dependency Inversion and injection. Honestly, I don't get it - so thats tonight sorted! Going to bring this up in our stand up tomorrow if I'm still not too sure.</p>

<hr>

<p>I don’t think I really have much else to say today. Oh! Actually, it was so embarrassing, I made a real mess of my presentation this morning on the string method split. I feel like I know split pretty well now, but I had a little tech issue so I couldn't do my examples in irb, and well, it all went down hill from there! Hopefully next time it will be better.</p>

<p>Apart from that, I am really sorry that I bailed out on climbing tonight Nikesh, Simon and co! I’ll be there next week :) </p>

<p>Goodnight! <br>
