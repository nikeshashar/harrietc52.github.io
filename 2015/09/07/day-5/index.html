            <p>Week 2!! <br>
Here we go! <br>
Battleships!</p>

<p>This time I promise I’m actually going to keep it short because I really want to go to bed! Over the weekend the airport challenge went okay. I need to be stricter with myself about sticking to the refractor loop, because I lost the routine of feature and unit tests, then got a bit lost in my own code. I missed having a buddy by my side to bounce ideas off, so I was definitely looking forward to getting back in to Makers to pair program today. </p>

<p>Me and Harry felt like we have had a productive day, although we don’t have a lot of code to show for this! The Battleships is the largest project by far up until now, although I think it is as much to do with planning, modelling and concepts as it is code, so because of this we spent quite a lot of time getting used to the user stories. But, of course we over complicated these and ended up deleting all our code before tackling it from a totally different angle after lunch. It hurt at the time, but its definitely a mature moment to say that what you actually need to do is start over!</p>

<p>We had originally started with trying to create a grid for the game, as nested arrays, (compltely blaming Chris Pine’s civilisation world for this) but issues followed because we weren’t completely sure how to set the boundaries, and we also struggled to place the ships vertically. So we went back to basics and created 3 small classes for water, ship and board. There is ALOT of work to be done tomorrow but I’m looking forward to it because I am a lot more confident with our approach and understanding what is the madness behind our methods.</p>

<p>Yoga was really great today (thanks Joe for dragging me away from my code- it was totally worth it) and tomorrow I have my first little presentation of any Ruby method of our choice. There are over 400 ruby methods and one by one we hope to have these nailed! I’ve chosen <code>split</code>. So just for practise - str.split divides a string into substrings based on their delimiter, returning an array of these substrings. I’ll then do a range of examples in irb and talk though them! </p>

<p>Keeping this short tonight, I’ll try and make up for it tomorrow after my first Makers climbing outing! <br>
Goodnight, <br>
