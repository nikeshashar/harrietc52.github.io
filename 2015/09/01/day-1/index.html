            <p><strong>First day at Makers!!</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>After speaking to a few of my new cohort pals, I think its fair to say I wasn't the only one who had a sleepless night on our Makers eve. But today was a great balance of getting to know each other and talks from our coaches, so there was really no need to be so nervous. Well not for our induction day anyway.. tomorrow is a whole different story!</p>

<p>Our first day kicked off at 8:30 in the kitchen with fresh croissants and pastries ordered in from Pret, and LOTS of cups of coffee. Tired conversation was flowing but by 9 everybody was excited and pumped ready to get going. Instead of diving straight into code, we did some bonding exercises, including a naming game and the spaghetti challenge. We learn’t a little later that the spaghetti challenge is a world famous challenge that give teams simple but really effective collaboration skills in what feels like the fastest 18 minutes of your life. Our little teams marshmallow reached the grand total height of 27cm. We were pretty chuffed with ourselves until we turned around to see a free standing spaghetti eiffel tower reaching around 60cm. Sam explained the point of this exercise, and how effective this challenge is in teaching people to develop projects in small steps, and always look for solutions continuously. In theory terms this is to put yourself in the marshmallows position and make sure you can always be stood up tall, and then that itself means you can keep growing. In tech terms this means making every iteration ready, if on qu you suddenly have to submit your code, it would still pass. Check out the marshmallow challenge <a href="http://marshmallowchallenge.com/Welcome.html">here</a>. </p>

<p>Also, quick little personal achievement! I am usually pretty terrible with names, but because of the name game, I can pretty confidently say I know the name and where each one of my peers is from..and its only the first day! This doesn't seem very impressive but theres 36 of us and some of the places I have honestly never heard of.</p>

<p>A few other lectures included how to try be the best Knowledge Workers you possible can, and a another lecture on literally Getting Stuck. The escalation process of potential help we should exhaust (error messages, pair partners, google, other cohort peers etc) before finally asking coaches for help. I think this being cruel to be kind approach will hopefully elevate our speed of problem solving efficiency in the long run. </p>

<p>I took little notes in most of these lectures, but only now when I am writing this post, I realised that I didn't even pick up my pencil in Dana’s (The Chief Joy Officer) talk. This is probably because I felt I was being hypnotised with her genuine happiness for 30 minutes, it was infectious! I have a feeling she is a real asset to the ‘Dream Makers’, as the coaches call themselves, and somebody who we will be going to in days when you might need a little pick me up.</p>

<p>By half 5 we were all cheering in the pub to surviving our first day. What we are trying to do in 12 weeks is complete madness, but I feel so lucky to just be ‘a Maker’ because the bond and atmosphere they have going around the three floors is really awesome. In 2 weeks I will be a mentor, 6 weeks a senior.. that has kind of just hit home! We asked for any advice as to was to do tonight to prepare, and Spike (another coach) replied saying just sleep. So I am going to bed! Heathy body, healthy mind is so important and with the daily meditation and yoga classes put on by Dana, they really, really encourage this. I am already exhausted, which I feel a little guilty about because I didn’t really do much today! And a bit nervous about how hard tomorrow will be, but Sam was quite firm in saying not to beat ourselves up about the pace we learn at. Everybody learns differently, and everybody here is bright and smart but in different ways. In these 12 weeks we will be retraining our brains to learn how to learn all over again.. Sounds pretty terrifying if you ask me!</p>

<p>But to ‘Trust them’ and ‘have fun - it will REALLY lighter the load' are the two things that I came away today thinking about. Oh and to also watch our posture because there are designated 'posture police' reappointment every week or so, and we’ll get probably an extra challenge or something knowing them if we are slouching!</p>

<p>Goodnight! <br>
