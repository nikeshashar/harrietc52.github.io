<hr>

<p>If the next 12 weeks continue like today and yesterday, I’m going to bore you with repeatedly saying how much fun each day is. Today was so great. But just real quick, I’ve read Day 1’s blog and I have realised I didn't even mention my cohort once, this needs to be appended!  So, well there is 36 of us, from all sorts of backgrounds, finance and marketing, professional poker player, straight from A levels and me, ex dancer. Everybody is so nice, and today I had ‘Aaron fro Essex’ and ‘Alex from Dallas, Texas’ programming next to me and they were so funny, me and my pair ‘Harry from London’ all laughed so much and even though we were sat at those screens for about 10 hours in total, it went so quick. </p>

<p>Today started with a stand up from Tansaku explaining our challenge for the rest of the week, which is a project that will hopefully be the infrastructure of how the Boris Bikes work around London. It was only five or so minutes long, and I came out not really knowing what was about to happen to be honest! But there was a great vibe going on and I was looking forward to getting started. The Boris Bikes repo consisted of ten little challenges that guided us through the first few steps that would supposedly, when present with <em>any</em> software project, should be a kind of template guide for us to follow through. </p>

<p>Later on we had out first meditation which was interesting! I think I liked it! Just it was very, very strange. I totally zoned out. Dana has told us to sit up straight, top of your head to the roof kind of thing, and then 15 minutes later when I was half conscious again,  had completed slouched over. I could feel my hands twitching loads and I felt a little ill and pretty uncomfortable when we had to concentrate on our internal breathing. Dana had told us yesterday meditation is just another skill, that would take time and practise, like anything, to get better at. Anyway, long story short, I was still totally awake will full concentration until about half 7, so I'm converted! Note to self: go everyday! </p>

<p>Just before this we had our first table tennis game. Alex taught us how to play ‘King’, which was pretty much 7 of us running around the ping pong table like lunatics, trying not crash into each other. Everyone was pretty crap apart from Alex, oh actually Usman was definitely the worst, but there is a lot more time for practise in that department! </p>

<p>After meditation me and my pair Harry got straight back and finished up to the Post Challenge 1. The last exercise in this was to write the whole program, that we have just spent about 8 hours on, from the start totally fresh! When we read this, there was a little temptation to skip over it to be honest! But we managed to do it in an hour, and it really surprised us both how much we had taken it. Great exercise :) </p>

<p>We called it a night at 8pm, after 10+ cups of tea, lunch, meditation, table tennis, an afternoon cereal break, and two stand ups! Pretty happy but mostly relieved that our first day of actual coding was so much fun, and we actually got quite far. </p>

<p>I don’t know how it is already 11 o’clock! After my nightly message on Slack to Joe perswading him to go to bed, I’m too shutting down for the night.</p>
