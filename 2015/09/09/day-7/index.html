            <p>All I think I want to mention tonight is how really great my cohort is! We had a September group meeting with Dana, our chief joy officer, and we just went around everybody for a minute or so talking about our thoughts and feelings, what we are enjoying, what we expected, finding hard, small victories etc. There were loads of really funny comments and its crazy to think we have only known each other 7 days. This sounds really cliche but it actually feels like a massive family already! </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong.. it is HARD, totally exhausting and today was yet another emotional rollercoaster, but there is so much support around us all and its just such an amazing place to be 12 hours every day.  </p>

<p>This photo was from day 1! Cant believe how much we have managed to cram into our heads since then!</p>

Sorry it is short tonight - I made a really poor attempt at a previous research project that needs serious tlc!</p>

<p>Goodnight! <br>
