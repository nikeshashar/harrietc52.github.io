&lt;p&gt;After speaking to a few of my new cohort pals, I think its fair to say I wasn't the only one who had a sleepless night on our Makers eve. But today was a great balance of getting to know each other and talks from our coaches, so there was really no need to be so nervous. Well not for our induction day anyway.. tomorrow is a whole different story!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first day kicked off at 8:30 in the kitchen with fresh croissants and pastries ordered in from Pret, and LOTS of cups of coffee. Tired conversation was flowing but by 9 everybody was excited and pumped ready to get going. Instead of diving straight into code, we did some bonding exercises, including a naming game and the spaghetti challenge. We learn’t a little later that the spaghetti challenge is a world famous challenge that give teams simple but really effective collaboration skills in what feels like the fastest 18 minutes of your life. Our little teams marshmallow reached the grand total height of 27cm. We were pretty chuffed with ourselves until we turned around to see a free standing spaghetti eiffel tower reaching around 60cm. Sam explained the point of this exercise, and how effective this challenge is in teaching people to develop projects in small steps, and always look for solutions continuously. In theory terms this is to put yourself in the marshmallows position and make sure you can always be stood up tall, and then that itself means you can keep growing. In tech terms this means making every iteration ready, if on qu you suddenly have to submit your code, it would still pass. Check out the marshmallow challenge &lt;a href="http://marshmallowchallenge.com/Welcome.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, quick little personal achievement! I am usually pretty terrible with names, but because of the name game, I can pretty confidently say I know the name and where each one of my peers is from..and its only the first day! This doesn't seem very impressive but theres 36 of us and some of the places I have honestly never heard of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few other lectures included how to try be the best Knowledge Workers you possible can, and a another lecture on literally Getting Stuck. The escalation process of potential help we should exhaust (error messages, pair partners, google, other cohort peers etc) before finally asking coaches for help. I think this being cruel to be kind approach will hopefully elevate our speed of problem solving efficiency in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took little notes in most of these lectures, but only now when I am writing this post, I realised that I didn't even pick up my pencil in Dana’s (The Chief Joy Officer) talk. This is probably because I felt I was being hypnotised with her genuine happiness for 30 minutes, it was infectious! I have a feeling she is a real asset to the ‘Dream Makers’, as the coaches call themselves, and somebody who we will be going to in days when you might need a little pick me up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By half 5 we were all cheering in the pub to surviving our first day. What we are trying to do in 12 weeks is complete madness, but I feel so lucky to just be ‘a Maker’ because the bond and atmosphere they have going around the three floors is really awesome. In 2 weeks I will be a mentor, 6 weeks a senior.. that has kind of just hit home! We asked for any advice as to was to do tonight to prepare, and Spike (another coach) replied saying just sleep. So I am going to bed! Heathy body, healthy mind is so important and with the daily meditation and yoga classes put on by Dana, they really, really encourage this. I am already exhausted, which I feel a little guilty about because I didn’t really do much today! And a bit nervous about how hard tomorrow will be, but Sam was quite firm in saying not to beat ourselves up about the pace we learn at. Everybody learns differently, and everybody here is bright and smart but in different ways. In these 12 weeks we will be retraining our brains to learn how to learn all over again.. Sounds pretty terrifying if you ask me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to ‘Trust them’ and ‘have fun - it will REALLY lighter the load' are the two things that I came away today thinking about. Oh and to also watch our posture because there are designated 'posture police' reappointment every week or so, and we’ll get probably an extra challenge or something knowing them if we are slouching!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodnight! &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joining Makers Academy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had six months since being accepted to Makers to prepare mentally, physically, emotionally (pretty much every way there is!) for potentially the most challenging 12 weeks I'll ever face. Its going to be hard, every blog I have read won’t let me forget it…&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/2015/08/30/pre-course/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">eda542fc-bfc9-420f-b08c-68d23e40ad95</guid><dc:creator>Harriet Craven</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2015 20:41:17 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joining Makers Academy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have had six months since being accepted to Makers to prepare mentally, physically, emotionally (pretty much every way there is!) for potentially the most challenging 12 weeks I'll ever face. Its going to be hard, every blog I have read won’t let me forget it… but I am so excited. I am currently in the midst of the final week of the Pre-course (four weeks of compulsory remote studying) and it has flown by! Before I applied to Makers, reading Makers alumni’s blogs really were the game changer for me - they were so honest, passionate and enthusiastic about their time at Makers Academy. So here’s hoping - I’ll try to do the same!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of Precourse week 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four hours later, and a very large glass of Rosé, I completed week 1’s challenge. My list of ‘history’ from the command line couldn't have been any messier!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucy, a fellow Septemberite, kept my sane when for the life of me, I couldn't figure out why my Unixoid-challenge wouldn't submit - I was in the wrong directory. Lets just say I won’t be making that hour long mistake again! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I missed the Pre-course launch evening. Everybody looked like they were having a ball as they listened to Nikesh talk though different aspects of the Makers journey, shortly followed by a trip to the local about 10 metres down the road. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been strongly suggested that we blog throughout the next 12 weeks as much as possible. To help us keep a clear record of everything we are learning if nothing else. I have never blogged before, and I am really pretty bad in the spelling and grammar department, so I am sorry for any typos in advance! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precourse Week 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Version control and GitHub. I didn’t realise how important GitHub was until this week. I had never heard of it before, but ultimately, it is the place where future employers will go to review our code. Github has many awesome features, including the abilities for a team push and pull each others code, allowing them to work simultaneously on the same project. Trust me, its great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Week two again could not have gone any faster. I feel like I am much more confident with forking, cloning, and it really makes me appreciate how important the Pre-course is. It continues to prepare us in small steps for the real 12 weeks, which lie in the not so far distance now. But I am sure, not matter how much we try now, it will still hit us like a tonne of bricks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also finally got my Ghost blog up and running this week- thanks to Usmans blog! His step by step guide was welcomed with open arms to a few of us on the cohort who were really struggling. Big shout out to Usman - check out the famous blog.. &lt;a href="http://usmanj.github.io/setting-up-a-ghost-blog-on-github/"&gt;Setting up a Ghost blog on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precourse Week 3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to start!! &lt;br&gt;
I’m struggling to put into words my ups and downs this week. Quickly getting out the way the fact my laptop crashed and I lost everything on it. 20 hours in Apple, two ruby days behind and a new laptop with a full night of reinstalling later… we are good to go - take two! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week quickly got a lot better on the Friday when I went into Makers for the first time since my interview. I pair programmed with Joe, and it was great. I learnt so much from him, he was so patient, and I think we both came away from our first pair programming experience really chuffed with ourselves. After a brief discussion, we wanted to do something useful and wrote a script to produce random pairs, making sure that a person doesn’t pair with someone they had previously paired with. We tested the ping pong technique, where you swap the driver, navigator rolls every 15 minutes or so. In my ignorance exited for the first rotation, I stood up ready to physically swap seats with Joe..you're probably shaking your head at me right now! Anyway, Joe contained his laughter very kindly and explained how using our new found GitHub skills, we simply make a new repo and push and pull each others code, both working on the most recent version, own computers, own swively blue chair! The following link is Joe's post about what we got up to in more detail..  &lt;a href="http://chn-challenger.github.io/pair-programming-and-more-codewars/"&gt;Pair Programming: Harriet and Joe&lt;/a&gt; Thank you Joe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing version 1, and a great but slightly rushed attempt of a more efficient version 2, it was time for the seniors graduation. The beers were out and the final projects where so impressive in quality and individuality. The fact that will be us in 12 weeks is completely terrifying! In the mean time, all Makers, past, present and future overflowed the pub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precourse Week 4:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final week of pre-course, where has the time gone! The more I’m learning the more I realise there is to learn, and all I want right now is more time. But I am currently sat on the train down to London, having waved bye to my parents on the platform, and now I’m having a little panic that I haven’t done enough work! Slack (the messaging app we use) felt pretty quiet this weekend, so maybe I wasn’t the only one making the most of our last few days of a social life. If any family/ friends are reading this, I am so sorry I am about to go off the radar for 3 months. I’ll see you all at Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the the rest of my final day of Pre-course I think I will try and avoid codewars, simply because it is just so addictive, and instead read up on some TDD and Rspec. I really can’t believe it’s September 1st tomorrow, I have been looking at the “Maker’s 12 weeks begin!” event in my calendar for so long, and its here… wish me luck, I really am going to need it! Quick trip to m&amp;amp;s to get the first of many packed lunches, early night and let the 12 weeks begin :D &lt;/p&gt;
